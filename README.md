## About Gateway

Gateway is basically a porting of WinSCP to terminal. So basically is a terminal tool with an UI to connect to a remote server to retrieve and upload files. It works both on Linux, MacOS and Windows (TODO: double check) and supports SFTP and FTPs.

### Why Gateway

It happens very often to me when using SCP at work to forget the path of a file on a remote machine, which forces me then to connect through SSH, gather the file path and finally download it through SCP. I could use WinSCP, but I use Linux and I pratically use the terminal for everything, so I wanted something like WinSCP on my terminal.

## Features

- Different communication protocols
  - SFTP
  - FTP and FTPS
- Practical user interface to explore the remote machine file system and to select the files to upload and download
- Written in Rust
- Easy to extend with new protocols

## Installation

If you're considering to install Gateway I want to thank you ðŸ’›! I hope this project can be useful for you!  
If you want to contribute to this project, don't forget to check out our contribute guide. [Read More](CONTRIBUTING.md)

### Requirements

- OpenSSL: only if you want **FTPS** support

#### Install OpenSSL on Windows

To install OpenSSL on Windows you have basically two options:

##### Precompiled Binaries

Download the precompiled binaries from <http://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html> (Non light installation); install to system path and then add to your environmental variables `OPENSSL_DIR=path\to\the\installation\dir`

##### Vcpkg

You can use [vcpkg](https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg) to install OpenSSL and then run

```dos
vcpkg install openssl:x64-windows
set VCPKG_ROOT=PATH_TO_VCPKG_INSTALLATION
```

### Cargo

```sh
# Install gateway through cargo
cargo install gateway
```

### Deb / Rpm

Coming soon

### Usage

Gateway can be started with the following options:

- `-v, --version` Print version info
- `-h, --help` Print help page

## Known issues

TODO:

## Upcoming Features

- **File viewer**: possibility to show in a popup the file content from the explorer.
- **OpenSSL Replacement**: OpenSSL is kinda an annoying stuff, especially for Windows. Unfortunately rust-ftp requires OpenSSL to build. I'm working on replacing it on [rust-ftp](https://github.com/wgalyen/rust-ftp/tree/rust-tls). If you want to give me a hand, feel free to contribute.
