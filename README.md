## About Gateway

Gateway is basically a porting of WinSCP to terminal. So basically is a terminal tool with an UI to connect to a remote server to retrieve and upload files. It works both on Linux, MacOS and Windows (TODO: double check) and supports SFTP and FTPs.

### Why Gateway

It happens very often to me when using SCP at work to forget the path of a file on a remote machine, which forces me then to connect through SSH, gather the file path and finally download it through SCP. I could use WinSCP, but I use Linux and I pratically use the terminal for everything, so I wanted something like WinSCP on my terminal.

## Features

- Different communication protocols
  - SFTP
  - FTP and FTPS
- Practical user interface to explore the remote machine file system and to select the files to upload and download
- Written in Rust
- Easy to extend with new protocols

---

## Known issues

- Time in explorer is `1 Jan 1970`, but shouldn't be: that's because chrono can't parse date in a different locale. So if your server has a locale different from the one on your machine, it won't be able to parse the date.

---

## Upcoming Features

- **File viewer**: possibility to show in a popup the file content from the explorer.
